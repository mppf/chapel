/*
  This module serves as a toolkit of common serial and parallel
  iterators. This is currently being worked upon, and contains
  only the ``repeat`` iterator tool as of now.
*/

module Itertools {

  /*
    Returns an object over and over again, a specified
    number of times.


    :arg arg: The object to be returned
    :type arg: `?`

    :arg times: The number of times to return
    :type times: `int`

    :yields: Object in the range ``1..times``

    :throws: ``IllegalArgumentError`` on parallel infinite iteration (see below)


    If the argument ``times`` has the value 0, it will return
    the object an infinite number of times.

    This iterator can be called in serial and parallel zippered contexts.

    .. note::
      This iterator is not suitable for parallel infinite iteration i.e.
      avoid using zippered, ``forall``, or ``coforall`` loops with the
      ``times`` argument set to 0.
