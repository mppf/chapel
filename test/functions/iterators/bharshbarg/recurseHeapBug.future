bug: use-after-free error for heap var in recursive iterator with coforall-on

The compiler incorrectly detects recursion for this test due to dynamic
dispatch, but that's not the main issue.

The parallel() pass allocates a heap var immediately before calling the
body of the recursive iterator, which contains an executeOnNB. The compiler
then inserts a free() for the heap var immediately after the call to the
recursive iterator body. This leads to a use-after-free bug because the
spawned coforall task is still using the heap var.
