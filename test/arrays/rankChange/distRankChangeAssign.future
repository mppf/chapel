distributed bulk interface breaks for rank-change views

Something about the distributed bulk interface seems to break when
assigning between a rank-change view.  From what I'm seeing in
ArrayViewRankChange.chpl, it seems that there's no conversion in
the domain passed in when passing it down to the underlying array
in routines like doiBulkTransferToDR(), but that's just based on
a quick glance.
