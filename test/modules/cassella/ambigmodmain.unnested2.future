bug: compiler failure when given two modules with same name that define main

A user discovered that when two inner modules are provided with the same name
and both define a main, if the ambiguous name is specified with the
--main-module flag then the compiler will arbitrarily choose the later module
as the desired module.  Ideally, we would like to see an error because M is
ambiguous instead of arbitrarily choosing one or the other.

When this is resolved, please update Jira issue 176
