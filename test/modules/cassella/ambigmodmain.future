bug: compiler failure when given two modules with same name that define main

A user discovered that when two inner modules are provided with the same name
and both define a main, if the ambiguous name is specified with the
--main-module flag then the compiler will arbitrarily choose the later module
as the desired module and, in deadCodeElimination, have an issue with cleaning
up the module whose main was not used.  Though the bug gets tickled at
deadCodeElimination, the theory is that this is related to resolution of the
main function and potentially a bug in scope resolve's resolution of module
names - ideally, we would like to see an error because M is ambiguous instead
of arbitrarily choosing one or the other.

When this is resolved, please update Jira issue 176
