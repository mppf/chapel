bug: compiler incorrectly applies 'const ref' intent to 'this' formal of initializer

The 'this' formal of an initializer should have INTENT_REF. If it doesn't, it
may confuse later passes expecting to find a def of the formal (by looking
for INTENT_REF). In this case, it trips an assertion in def/use analysis while
attempting to broadcast a const global record.
