============================
Using Chapel on Cray Systems
============================

The following information is assembled to help Chapel users get up and running
on Cray\ |reg| systems including the Cray XC\ |trade|, XE\ |trade|, XK\
|trade|, and CS\ |trade| series systems.

.. contents::


----------------------------------------------------
Getting Started with Chapel on Cray X-Series Systems
----------------------------------------------------

Chapel is available as a module for Cray X-series systems.  When it is
installed on your system, you do not need to build Chapel from the
source release (though you can). To use Chapel with the default settings and
confirm it is correctly installed, do the following:

1) Load the Chapel module::

     module load chapel


2) Compile an example program using::

     chpl -o hello6-taskpar-dist $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6-taskpar-dist.chpl


3) Execute the resulting executable (on four locales)::

     ./hello6-taskpar-dist -nl 4


This may be all that is necessary to use Chapel on a Cray X-Series system.
If the installation setup by your system administrator deviates from
the default settings, or you are interested in other configuration
options, see `Using Chapel on a Cray System`_ below.  If instead you wish to
build Chapel from source, continue on to
`Building Chapel for a Cray System from Source`_ just below.

For information on obtaining and installing the Chapel module please
contact your system administrator.


----------------------------------------------
Getting Started with Chapel on Cray CS Systems
----------------------------------------------

On Cray CS systems, Chapel is not currently available as a module due
to the wide diversity of software packages that Cray CS customers may
choose to install on their system.  For this reason, Chapel must be
built from source on Cray CS systems using the
`Building Chapel for a Cray System from Source`_ instructions just below.


---------------------------------------------
Building Chapel for a Cray System from Source
---------------------------------------------

1) If using a XC, XE, or XK system, continue to step 2. If using a
   CS series system, set ``CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM`` to ``cray-cs``.

   For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

      export CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM=cray-cs

   These are the supported systems and strings.  Note that these values
   are used by default when building on the given systems.  They can
   also be set manually.  Also note that the ``cray-xe`` configuration
   covers Cray XK systems as well as Cray XE systems.

       =========  ==================
       System     CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM
       =========  ==================
       CS series  cray-cs
       XC series  cray-xc
       XE series  cray-xe
       XK series  cray-xe
       =========  ==================


2) Optionally, set the ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` environment variable to indicate
   how Chapel should launch jobs on your system:

      ========================================  =========================
      On a Cray CS system, to...                set CHPL_LAUNCHER to...
      ========================================  =========================
      ...run jobs interactively on your system  gasnetrun_ibv
      ...queue jobs using PBSPro (qsub)         pbs-gasnetrun_ibv
      ...queue jobs using SLURM (sbatch)        slurm-gasnetrun_ibv
      ...queue jobs using LSF (bsub)            lsf-gasnetrun_ibv
      ========================================  =========================

      ========================================  =========================
      On a Cray X-series system, to...          set CHPL_LAUNCHER to...
      ========================================  =========================
      ...run jobs interactively on your system  aprun
      ...queue jobs using PBS (qsub)            pbs-aprun
      ...queue jobs using SLURM (sbatch)        slurm-srun
      ========================================  =========================

   You can also set CHPL_LAUNCHER to ``none`` if you prefer to manually
   manage all queuing and job launch commands yourself.

   On Cray CS systems, ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` defaults to ``gasnetrun_ibv``.

   On Cray X-Series systems, ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` defaults to ``aprun`` if
   ``aprun`` is in your path, ``slurm-srun`` if ``srun`` is in your path
   and ``none`` otherwise.

   For more information on Chapel's launcher capabilities and options,
   refer to :ref:`readme-launcher`.


3) Select the target compiler that Chapel should use when compiling
   code for the compute node:

   On a Cray CS series system, set the ``CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER`` environment
   variable to indicate which compiler to use (and make sure that the compiler
   is in your path).

      ===========================  ==============================
      To request...                set CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER to...
      ===========================  ==============================
      ...the GNU compiler (gcc)    gnu    (default)
      ...the Intel compiler (icc)  intel
      ...the PGI compiler (pgcc)   pgi
      ===========================  ==============================

   On a Cray X-series system, ensure that you have one of the following
   Programming Environment modules loaded to specify your target compiler::

       PrgEnv-cray
       PrgEnv-gnu
       PrgEnv-intel
       PrgEnv-pgi

   For PrgEnv-cray we recommend using CCE 8.4 or newer for best performance.
   This allows us to build our recommended third-party packages (i.e. allows
   us to default to CHPL_TASKS=qthreads instead of CHPL_TASKS=fifo)

4) By default, ``g++`` will be used to compile code that runs on the login
   node, such as the Chapel compiler and launcher code.  Optionally, you can
   override this default by setting ``CHPL_HOST_COMPILER`` to one of the
   following values:

     :``gnu``: the GNU compiler suite -- ``gcc`` and ``g++``
     :``intel``: the Intel compiler suite -- ``icc`` and ``icpc``
     :``pgi``: the PGI compiler suite -- ``pgcc`` and ``pgc++``


5) Optionally, set one or more of the following environment variables to
   configure the Chapel build.  These are described in greater detail in
   :ref:`readme-chplenv`.

     :``CHPL_TASKS``: tasking implementation, default ``qthreads``
     :``CHPL_COMM``: communication implementation, default ``ugni`` on
                     XC/XE systems, ``gasnet`` on CS systems

   For CS\ |trade| series systems, see :ref:`readme-infiniband` for
   information about using Chapel with InfiniBand.


6) Make sure you're in the top-level chapel/ directory and make/re-make the
   compiler and runtime::

     gmake

   Note that a single Chapel installation can support multiple
   configurations simultaneously and that you can switch between them
   simply by changing any of the above settings.  However, each
   configuration must be built separately.  Thus, you can change any of
   the settings in the steps before this, and then re-run this step in
   order to create additional installations.  Thereafter, you can switch
   between any of these configurations without rebuilding.


-----------------------------
Using Chapel on a Cray System
-----------------------------

1) If you are working from a Chapel module:

     a) Load the module using ``module load chapel``
     b) Optionally select a launcher, as in step 2 above
     c) Select a target compiler, as in step 3 above

   If you are working from a source installation:

     a) Set your host platform as in step 1 above
     b) Optionally select a launcher, as in step 2 above
     c) Select a target compiler, as in step 3 above
     d) Set ``CHPL_HOME`` and your paths by invoking the appropriate
        ``util/setchplenv`` script for your shell.  For example:

      .. code-block:: sh

        source util/setchplenv.bash


2) Optionally, set one or more of the following environment variables to
   select a Chapel configuration.  These are described in greater detail
   in :ref:`readme-chplenv`.

     :``CHPL_TASKS``: tasking implementation, default ``qthreads``
     :``CHPL_COMM``: communication implementation, default ``ugni`` on Cray
                     XC/XE, ``gasnet`` on Cray CS

   For CS\ |trade| series systems, see :ref:`readme-infiniband` for
   information about using Chapel with InfiniBand.

   The configuration selected must be one that is present in the Chapel
   installation being used, whether that is a source distribution or the
   pre-built module.  If it is not, the Chapel compiler will produce an
   error message saying so when you try to compile anything.  If you get
   this error, you will need to build the desired configuration (if you
   are working from source) or modify your configuration so that it is
   one of those supplied (if you are working with the pre-built module).


3) Compile your Chapel program.  For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chpl -o hello6-taskpar-dist $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6-taskpar-dist.chpl

   See :ref:`readme-compiling` or  ``man chpl`` for further details.


4) If ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` is set to anything other than ``none``, when you
   compile a Chapel program for your Cray system, you will see two
   binaries (e.g., ``hello6-taskpar-dist`` and ``hello6-taskpar-dist_real``).
   The first binary contains code to launch the Chapel program onto
   the compute nodes, as specified by your ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` setting.  The
   second contains the program code itself; it is not intended to be
   executed directly from the shell prompt.

   You can use the ``-v`` flag to see the commands used by the launcher
   binary to start your program.

   If ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` is ``pbs-aprun`` or ``pbs-gasnetrun_ibv``:

     a) You can optionally specify a queue name using the environment
        variable ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_QUEUE``.  For example:

          .. code-block:: sh

            export CHPL_LAUNCHER_QUEUE=batch

        If this variable is left unset, no queue name will be
        specified.  Alternatively, you can set the queue name on your
        Chapel program command line using the ``--queue`` flag.

     b) You can also optionally set a wall clock time limit for the
        job using ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_WALLTIME``.  For example to specify a
        10-minute time limit, use:

          .. code-block:: sh

            export CHPL_LAUNCHER_WALLTIME=00:10:00

        Alternatively, you can set the wall clock time limit on your
        Chapel program command line using the ``--walltime`` flag.

   If ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` is ``slurm-gasnetrun_ibv``:

     You must set the amount of time to request from SLURM.
     For example, the following requests 15 minutes:

      .. code-block:: sh

        export CHPL_LAUNCHER_WALLTIME=00:15:00

   For further information about launchers, please refer to
   :ref:`readme-launcher`.


5) Execute your Chapel program.  Multi-locale executions require the
   number of locales (compute nodes) to be specified on the command
   line.  For example::

     ./hello6-taskpar-dist -nl 2

   Requests the program to be executed using two locales.


6) If your Cray system has compute nodes with varying numbers of
   cores, you can request nodes with at least a certain number of
   cores using the variable ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_CORES_PER_LOCALE``.  For
   example, on a Cray system in which some compute nodes have 24 or
   more cores per compute node, you could request nodes with at least
   24 cores using:

   .. code-block:: sh

      export CHPL_LAUNCHER_CORES_PER_LOCALE=24

   This variable may be needed when you are using the aprun launcher and
   running Chapel programs within batch jobs you are managing yourself.
   The aprun launcher currently creates aprun commands that request the
   maximum number of cores per locale found on any locale in the system,
   irrespective of the fact that the batch job may have a lower limit
   than that on the number of cores per locale.  If the batch job limit
   is less than the maximum number of cores per locale, you will get the
   following error message when you try to run a Chapel program::

      apsched: claim exceeds reservation's CPUs

   You can work around this by setting ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_CORES_PER_LOCALE`` to
   the same or lesser value as the number of cores per locale specified
   for the batch job (for example, the mppdepth resource for the PBS
   qsub command).  In the future we hope to achieve better integration
   between Chapel launchers and workload managers.


7) If your Cray system has compute nodes with varying numbers of CPUs
   per compute unit, you can request nodes with a certain number of
   CPUs per compute unit using the variable ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_CPUS_PER_CU``.
   For example, on a Cray XC series system with some nodes having at
   least 2 CPUs per compute unit, to request running on those nodes
   you would use:

   .. code-block:: sh

      export CHPL_LAUNCHER_CPUS_PER_CU=2

   Currently, the only legal values for ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_CPUS_PER_CU`` are
   0 (the default), 1, and 2.

--------------------------------------
Cray File Systems and Chapel execution
--------------------------------------

For best results, it is recommended that you execute your Chapel
program by placing the binaries on a file system shared between the
login node and compute nodes (typically Lustre), as this will provide
the greatest degree of transparency when executing your program.  In
some cases, running a Chapel program from a non-shared file system
will make it impossible to launch onto the compute nodes.  In other
cases, the launch will succeed, but any files read or written by the
Chapel program will be opened relative to the compute node's file
system rather than the login node's.


----------------------------------------------------
Special Notes for Cray XC, XE, and XK Series Systems
----------------------------------------------------

Controlling the Heap Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running on Cray XC/XE/XK systems using either of the following
configurations, the comm layer needs to know the maximum size the
program heap will grow to during execution::

  CHPL_COMM=gasnet
    CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=gemini or aries
    CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT=fast or large

or::

  CHPL_COMM=ugni, with a craype-hugepages module loaded

With ``CHPL_COMM=gasnet``, by default the heap will occupy as much of the
free memory on each locale (compute node) as the runtime can acquire,
less some amount to allow for demands from other (system) programs
running there.  With ``CHPL_COMM=ugni`` when a craype-hugepages module is
loaded, by default the heap will occupy 2/3 of the free memory on each
locale.  With the ugni comm layer and slurm job placement, however, this
default is reduced to 16 GiB if that is less.

Advanced users may want to make the heap smaller than this.  Programs
start more quickly with a smaller heap, and in the unfortunate event
that you need to produce core files, those will be written more quickly
if the heap is smaller.  However, note that if you reduce the heap size
to less than the amount your program actually needs and then run it, it
will terminate prematurely due to not having enough memory.

To change the heap size, set the ``CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`` environment
variable.  Set it to just a number to specify the size of the heap in
bytes, or to a number with a ``k`` or ``K``, ``m`` or ``M``, or ``g`` or ``G``
suffix with no intervening spaces to specify the heap size in KiB (2^10
bytes), MiB (2^20 bytes), or GiB (2^30 bytes), respectively.  Any of the
following would set the heap size to 1 GiB, for example:

  .. code-block:: sh

    export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1073741824
    export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1048576k
    export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1024m
    export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1g

Note that the value you set in ``CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`` may get rounded up
internally to match the page alignment.  How much, if any, this will add
depends on the hugepage size in any craype-hugepage module you have loaded at
the time you execute the program.

Note that for ``CHPL_COMM=gasnet``, ``CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`` is synonymous with
``GASNET_MAX_SEGSIZE``, and the former overrides the latter if both are set.


Native Communication Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`readme-multilocale` page describes a variety of communication
layers that can be used by Chapel programs.  In addition to the standard
runtime layers available, Chapel supports a Cray-specific ``ugni``
communication layer. The ``ugni`` communication layer interacts with the
system's network interface very closely through a lightweight interface
called uGNI (user Generic Network Interface).  On Cray XC or XE systems
the default is to use the ugni communication layer.


Using the ugni Communications Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use ugni communications:

1) Set your CHPL_COMM environment variable to ``ugni`` (the default):

   .. code-block:: sh

      export CHPL_COMM=ugni

   This specifies that you wish to use the Cray-specific communication
   layer.


2) Set your CHPL_TASKS environment variable to ``qthreads`` (the
   default) or ``fifo``:

   .. code-block:: sh

     export CHPL_TASKS=qthreads

   or:

   .. code-block:: sh

     export CHPL_TASKS=fifo

   All of these tasking layers work with ugni communications.  Other
   Chapel environment variables having to do with runtime layers can
   be left unset.  Setting ``CHPL_COMM`` and ``CHPL_TASKS`` like this
   will cause the correct combination of other runtime layers that work
   with those to be selected automatically.


3) *(Optional)* Load an appropriate craype-hugepages module.  For example::

     module load craype-hugepages16M

   The ugni communication layer can be used with or without so-called
   *hugepages*.  Performance for remote variable references is better
   when hugepages are used.  However, using hugepages effectively may
   require setting ``CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`` to a value large enough to
   encompass the program's memory needs (see `Controlling the Heap
   Size`_, above), and that quantity can be hard to know.  Using
   hugepages also means that the tasking layer cannot use guard pages to
   detect task stack overflows (see below).

   To use hugepages, you must have a ``craype-hugepages`` module loaded
   both when building your program and when running it.
   There are several hugepage modules, with suffixes indicating the page
   size they support.  For example, ``craype-hugepages16M`` supports 16 MiB
   hugepages.  It does not matter which ``craype-hugepages`` module you have
   loaded when you build your program.  Any of them will do.  However,
   which one you have loaded when you run your program does matter.  For
   general use, the Chapel group recommends the ``craype-hugepages16M``
   module.  You can read on for more information about ``craype-hugepage``
   modules if you would like, but the recommended ``craype-hugepages16M``
   module will probably give you satisfactory results.

   The architecture of the Cray network interface chips (NICs) limits
   them to addressing at most 16k (2**14) pages of memory.  This is
   sufficient to cover a 32 GiB Cray XC locale with 2 MiB pages.  But
   if you will be running on 64 GiB locales, you will need to use at
   least 4 MiB pages to cover all of the memory.  Generally, using
   larger hugepage sizes results in modest performance benefits,
   mostly in program startup time.  The ``craype-hugepages16M`` module
   will result in slightly faster program startup, and its 16 MiB
   hugepages will cover the locale memory on any Cray X-series system.

   The only downside to larger page sizes is that they can waste more
   memory than smaller page sizes do, when the data segments that reside
   on them are smaller than the hugepage size (which is often the case).
   In practice, however, the effect of this is minor.  Even using the
   fairly large 16 MiB hugepages will typically only result in around 1%
   of the total locale memory being wasted.

When hugepages are used with the ugni comm layer, tasking layers
cannot use guard pages for stack overflow detection.  Qthreads tasking
can only use guard pages for stack overflow detection, so if ugni
communications is combined with qthreads tasking, overflow detection is
turned off completely.

There is one special parameter recognized by the ugni communication
layer:


Communication Layer Concurrency
_______________________________

The ``CHPL_RT_COMM_CONCURRENCY`` environment variable tells the ugni
communication layer how much program concurrency it should try to
support.  This basically controls how much of the communication
resources on the NIC will be used by the program.  The default
value is the number of hardware processor cores the program will
use for Chapel tasks (``CHPL_RT_NUM_HARDWARE_THREADS`` in the next
section).  Usually this is enough, but for highly parallel codes
that do a lot of remote references, increasing it may help the
performance.  Useful values for ``CHPL_RT_COMM_CONCURRENCY`` are in
the range 1 to 30.  Values specified outside this range are
silently increased or reduced so as to fall within it.


---------------
Network Atomics
---------------

The Gemini(TM) and Aries(TM) networks support remote atomic memory
operations (AMOs) on XC, XE, and XK series systems.  When the ``CHPL_COMM``
environment variable is set to ``ugni``, the following operations on
remote atomics are done using the network::

    32- and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer types:
    32- and 64-bit floating point types:
      read()
      write()
      exchange()
      compareExchange()
      add(), fetchAdd()
      sub(), fetchSub()

    32- and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer types:
      or(),  fetchOr()
      and(), fetchAnd()
      xor(), fetchXor()

Note that on XE and XK systems, which have Gemini networks, out of the
above list only the 64-bit integer operations are done natively by the
network hardware.  32-bit integer and all floating point operations are
done using implicit ``on`` statements inside the ugni communication
layer, accelerated by Gemini hardware capabilities.

On XC systems, which have Aries networks, all of the operations shown
above are done natively by the network hardware.

.. _readme-cray-constraints:

--------------------------
Known Constraints and Bugs
--------------------------

* Our PBS launcher explicitly supports PBS Pro, Moab/Torque, and the
  NCCS site versions of PBS.  It may also work with other versions.
  If our PBS launcher does not work for you, you can fall back on a
  more manual launch of your program. For example, supposing the
  program is compiled to ``myprogram``:

  - Launch the ``myprogram_real`` binary manually using aprun and your own
    qsub script or command.

  - Use ``./myprogram --generate-qsub-script`` to generate a qsub script.
    Then edit the generated script and launch the ``myprogram_real`` binary
    manually as above.

* Redirecting stdin when executing a Chapel program under PBS/qsub
  may not work due to limitations of qsub.

* GASNet targets multiple network *conduits* as the underlying
  communication mechanism.  On certain platforms, the Chapel build
  will use the ``mpi`` conduit as the default.  As a result of using the
  mpi conduit, you may see a GASNet warning message at program start
  up.  To squelch this message, you can set the environment variable
  ``GASNET_QUIET=yes``.

* For X-series systems, there is a known issue with the Cray MPI
  release that causes some programs to assert and then hang during
  exit.  A workaround is to set the environment variable,
  ``MPICH_GNI_DYNAMIC_CONN`` to ``disabled``.  Setting this environment
  variable affects all MPI programs, so remember to unset it after
  running your Chapel program.

* The amount of memory available to a Chapel program running over
  GASNet with the gemini and aries conduits is allocated at program
  start up.  The default memory segment size may be too high on some
  platforms, resulting in an internal Chapel error or a GASNet
  initialization error such as::

     node 1 log gasnetc_init_segment() at $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/gemini-conduit/gasnet_gemini.c:<line#>: MemRegister segment fault 8 at  0x2aab6ae00000 60000000, code GNI_RC_ERROR_RESOURCE

  If your Chapel program exits with such an error, try setting the
  environment variable ``CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`` or ``GASNET_MAX_SEGSIZE`` to a
  lower value than the default (say 1G) and re-running your program.
  For more information, refer to the discussion of ``CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE``
  above and/or the discussion of ``GASNET_MAX_SEGSIZE`` here::

     $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/README


---------------
NCCS user notes
---------------

* NCCS Cray systems use a different qsub mechanism in order to
  enforce their queuing policies.  We have attempted to make our
  pbs-aprun launch code work with this version of qsub, but require a
  ``CHPL_LAUNCHER_ACCOUNT`` environment variable to be set to specify your
  NCCS account name.  For example:

  .. code-block:: sh

    export CHPL_LAUNCHER_ACCOUNT=MYACCOUNTID

* NCCS users either need to specify ``debug`` as their queue or set an
  explicit wall clock time limit using the mechanisms described above.
